# Xamarin_Password_Gen

Hello Guys, 
This is a Xamarin Project and the concept of this is 
To Generate a Password and showing it to the user.
The user is able to choose all of these or even anyone 
From Upper Case, Lower Case, Numbers, Special Chars, Empty Space.
And the user can also specify the Length of the password to be generated.

This project has only the required fiels to create the UI and logic.
You can use this with some editing in namespaces.

This rectify all the bugs and errors which usually pops out
Using try catch method and also focused for performance
Even while creating a password of length 10000.
